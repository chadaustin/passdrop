# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to the PassDrop 2 app on iOS.

PassDrop synchronizes the password database with Dropbox using Dropbox's standard [SwiftyDropbox](https://github.com/dropbox/SwiftyDropbox) SDK. No information about your Dropbox account is collected locally or remotely.

Beyond that, PassDrop runs entirely offline. No information about you, your passwords, or your device are collected.
